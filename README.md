# <b>Dashboard for CEOT IoT experimental sensor network</b>
This repository contains the python code to create a dashboard to visualize the data streaming from CEOT's experimental sensor network, that monitored an orange orchard in the south of Portugal between February and July 2022. The code uses plotly express and dash to display the real-time data by quering an influxDB data base.
